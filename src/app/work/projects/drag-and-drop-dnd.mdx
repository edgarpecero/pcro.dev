## Introduction
The React Drag-and-Drop Kanban Board is a project management tool designed to help users organize tasks efficiently. Inspired by Jira, this application allows users to manage tasks using a Kanban-style board with columns for "To-Do", "In Progress", and "Done". It also includes a Trash Zone for deleted tasks and supports drag-and-drop functionality for seamless task management.

## Features
- **Columns**: Organize tasks into "To-Do", "In Progress", and "Done" columns.
- **Trash Zone**: A dedicated area to delete tasks.
- **Deleted Tasks List**: View and manage tasks that have been moved to the Trash Zone.
- **Task Creation**: Easily create new tasks by entering a title and description.
- **Drag and Drop**: Move tasks between columns using intuitive drag-and-drop functionality.

## Technologies Used
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: A typed superset of JavaScript for better developer productivity and code quality.
- **dnd-kit/core**: A lightweight, performant, and extensible drag-and-drop toolkit for React.
