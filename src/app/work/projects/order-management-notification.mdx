## Introduction
The Order Management and Notification System is a robust e-commerce solution designed to handle order processing and notifications efficiently. The project leverages a microservices architecture to ensure scalability, resilience, and high performance.

## Objective
The primary goal of this project was to develop a system capable of:
- Managing high volumes of orders.
- Sending real-time notifications to customers and stakeholders.
- Scaling horizontally to handle increased workloads.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend:**  React 18.3.1, Typescript 4.9.5Â 
- **Backend:** Java 21, Spring Boot 3.3.5
- **Cloud Services:** AWS (EKS, ECR, S3, DynamoDB, RDS (SQL Server), SNS, SES, IAM, CloudFormation)
- **Orchestration:** Kubernetes (K8s)
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions

## Architecture
The system is based on a microservices architecture, with each service dedicated to a specific function:
- **Order Service:** Handles order creation, updates, and retrieval.
- **Notification Service:** Manages email and SMS notifications.

All services communicate asynchronously through **AWS SQS** to ensure reliability and fault tolerance.

## Key Features
- **Order Processing:** Streamlined workflows to handle order lifecycles.
- **Notifications:** Configurable email and SMS notifications for order status updates.
- **Scalability:** Horizontal scaling to handle traffic surges.
- **High Availability:** Deployment on Kubernetes clusters to ensure uptime.

## Challenges and Solutions
- **Challenge:** Handling real-time notifications for a large user base.
  - **Solution:** Implemented asynchronous processing using AWS SQS and Lambda functions to trigger events when a DynamoDB records has been created, updated or deleted.
- **Challenge:** Ensuring data consistency across distributed services.
  - **Solution:** Used DynamoDB with eventual consistency and designed idempotent endpoints.

## Results
The system successfully:
- Processed thousands of orders daily without downtime.
- Delivered notifications with a latency of less than 2 seconds.
- Scaled dynamically during high-demand events, maintaining optimal performance.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrated the effectiveness of microservices and cloud-native technologies in building scalable and resilient systems. It highlights my expertise in architecting and implementing enterprise-level solutions.
