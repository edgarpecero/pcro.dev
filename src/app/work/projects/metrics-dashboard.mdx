## Introduction
The Metrics Dashboard is a React-based project designed to track and visualize key performance indicators (KPIs) for two types of tickets: Incidents and Change Requests. This dashboard provides a comprehensive view of ticket metrics, allowing users to monitor open tickets, closed tickets, in-progress tickets, mean time to resolve, and SLA compliance.

- **Combined View**: Display metrics for both ticket types by selecting the "All" option.
- **Key Metrics**:
  - Open Tickets
  - Closed Tickets
  - In-Progress Tickets
  - Mean Time to Resolve (MTTR)
  - SLA Compliance
- **Visualizations**:
  - New & Closed Ticket Count
  - SLA Compliance by Incident Severity
  - New Ticket Count & MTTR (Days)
  - Age of In-Progress Tickets
  - Breakdown of New Tickets
  - Top Reasons for Creating Tickets

## Technologies Used
