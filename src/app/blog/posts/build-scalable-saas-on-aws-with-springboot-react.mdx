## Introduction

This project develops a microservices-based order management and notification platform for an e-commerce business, ensuring scalability, resilience, and high availability. Built with Spring Boot (Java) and React, the system leverages AWS cloud infrastructure, Kubernetes for container orchestration, and Terraform for infrastructure automation. It integrates a CI/CD pipeline with unit testing, code quality analysis, and automated deployments, following SOLID principles and Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) best practices. Additional features include message queue-based event handling, monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana, centralized logging (ELK/EFK stack), and fault-tolerant mechanisms like Circuit Breaker and Retry patterns.

## Project Description

### Microservices:

#### Order Microservice:
- Manages the lifecycle of customer orders, including creation, updates, and queries.
- Generates status change events via a message queue.

#### Notification Microservice:
- Listens for events from the message queue and sends notifications (email/SMS).

### Functional and Non-Functional Requirements:
- **Unit Testing:** JUnit for Java, integrated into the CI/CD pipeline.
- **Programming Best Practices:** SOLID principles.
- **Containerized Deployment:** Docker and Kubernetes.
- **CI/CD Pipeline:** Jenkins/GitHub Actions.
- **Infrastructure as Code:** Terraform or CloudFormation.
- **Resilience:** Failure recovery and fault tolerance mechanisms.
- **Monitoring & Alerts:** Prometheus and Grafana.
- **Scalability:** Horizontal scaling.

- **Frontend:** React 18.3.1, Typescript 4.9.5
- **Containerization:** Docker (AWS ECR), Kubernetes (AWS EKS).
- **Automation & CI/CD:** GitHub Actions.
- **Infrastructure:** AWS, Terraform, CloudFormation.
- **Monitoring:** Prometheus, Grafana.
- **Testing:** JUnit.
