## Difference between File Storage, Block Storage and Object Storage on AWS.

AWS offers these three main types of stages. Each serves different use cases based on performance, scalability and access patters.

- **File Storage**: Best for shared storage and hierarchical file structure (folders and directories)
- **Block Storage**: Best for databases and apps needing low-latency access.
- **Object Storage**: Best for storing large amounts of unstructured data.

### 1. File Storage (e.g., AWS EFS, Amazon FSx)

How it works?
- Stores data in hierarchical structures
- Uses NFS (Network File System) or SMB (Server Message Block) protocol
- Multiple servers or instances can access the same file system

Use Cases
- Shared storage for multiple EC2 instances
- Web apps that need centralized file access
- Media processing and machine learning

### 2. Block Storage (e.g. Amazon EBS)

How it works?
- Stores data in fixed-sized blocks (like a traditional hard drive)
- Each block has an address but is managed independently
- Commonly used with databases and transactional workloads
- Typically attached to a single EC2 instance

Use Cases
- High-performance applications (e.g. MySQL, PostgreSQL)
- Boot volumes for EC2 instances
- Applications requiring fast, low-latency access

### 3. Object Storage (e.g. Amazon S3)

How it works?
- Stores data as objects, each with metadata and a unique ID
- No hierarchical structure; objects are stored in buckets.
- Designed for high scalability and durability

Use Cases
- Static content hosting (e.g. images, videos, backups)
- Data lakes and big data analytics
- Archiving and long-term storage

| **Scalability**             | High (but limited by protocol)| Limited (must resize manually) | Virtually unlimited            |
| **Performance**             | Medium                        | High (low latency)             | Medium-High (depends on S3 tier)|
| **Use Cases**               | Shared storage, applications, ML | Databases, boot volumes       | Backups, media storage, data lakes |
| **AWS Service**             | EFS, FSx                      | EBS                            | S3   */}
