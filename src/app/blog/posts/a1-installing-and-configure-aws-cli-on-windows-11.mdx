## Introduction

This guide covers the installation and configuration of AWS CLI v2 on Windows 11. AWS CLI enables you to interact with AWS services from your command line, making it a powerful tool for cloud management and automation.

---

## 1. Prerequisites
- Administrator privileges on Windows 11.
- An AWS account for configuring credentials.

## 2. Downloading and Installing AWS CLI v2

### Step 1: Download the AWS CLI Installer
- Visit the [AWS CLI v2 download page](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html) to download the Windows installer.

### Step 2: Install AWS CLI
- Run the downloaded `.msi` file and follow the installation prompts.

## 3. Configuring AWS CLI

Once installed, configure the CLI to interact with your AWS account.

### Step 1: Open Command Prompt or PowerShell and run:

<CodeBlock className="my-24"
    compact
    codeInstances={[
        {
            code: 'aws configure',
            label: 'aws-configure',
            language: 'bash'
        },
    ]}
    copyButton
/>

### Step 2:  Provide your credentials:

- **AWS Access Key ID**
- **AWS Secret Access Key**
- **Default region name** (e.g., us-east-1)
- **Default output format** (e.g., json) or skip pressing down enter key.

## 4. Verifying Installation:

To confirm the AWS CLI installation and configuration, run:

<CodeBlock className="my-24"
    compact
    codeInstances={[
        {
            code: 'aws sts get-caller-identity',
            label: 'aws sts get-caller-identity',
            language: 'bash'
        },
    ]}
    copyButton
/>

You should see account details, confirming the CLI is set up.

<CodeBlock className="my-24"
    compact
    codeInstances={[
        {
            code: '$ aws sts get-caller-identity \n { \n "UserId": "AXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXZ", \n "Account": "7XXXXXXXXX", \n "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::7XXXXXXXXX:user/edgar" \n }',
            label: 'aws identity respone',
            language: 'bash'
        },
    ]}
    copyButton
/>



## 5. Troubleshooting

### Error: ‘aws’ is not recognized as an internal or external command
- Ensure AWS CLI is in your system’s PATH.

### Incorrect or Missing Credentials
- Double-check that you’ve entered the correct AWS Access Key and Secret Key.

## 6. Conclusion

With AWS CLI installed and configured, you can now access and manage AWS resources directly from your command line.
