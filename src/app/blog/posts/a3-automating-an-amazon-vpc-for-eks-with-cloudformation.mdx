# Automating an Amazon VPC for EKS with CloudFormation

Creating a VPC for an Amazon EKS cluster is critical, and AWS provides a CloudFormation template in the [EKS VPC guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/creating-a-vpc.html) to automate this process—saving you from manual configuration hassles.

## Understanding the VPC from the CloudFormation Template

The template builds a robust VPC designed for EKS:
- **VPC**: A virtual network with a default CIDR block like `10.0.0.0/16`, giving you ample IP space.
- **Subnets**: Spread across at least two Availability Zones (AZs) for high availability:
  - **Public Subnets**: Host resources like load balancers, with CIDRs like `10.0.0.0/24`.
  - **Private Subnets**: House EKS worker nodes, isolated from the public internet, e.g., `10.0.64.0/24`.
- **NAT Gateways**: Deployed in public subnets, allowing private subnets to pull container images or fetch updates without exposing nodes.
- **Internet Gateway**: Attached to the VPC, enabling public subnet traffic to the internet.
- **Route Tables**: Configured to route traffic efficiently—public subnets to the internet gateway, private subnets via NAT gateways.

This architecture balances security (private nodes) and connectivity (public access for load balancers), meeting EKS best practices.

## Deploying the VPC with CloudFormation

Instead of manually piecing this together in the AWS Console, CloudFormation automates it. Here’s how to use it:
1. **Get the Template**: Download the YAML file from the [EKS VPC guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/creating-a-vpc.html).
2. **Access CloudFormation**: In the AWS Console, go to CloudFormation, click "Create Stack," and choose "With new resources."
3. **Upload and Configure**: Upload the template, then input parameters like:
   - VPC CIDR (e.g., `10.0.0.0/16`).
   - Subnet CIDRs for public and private subnets.
   - AZs (e.g., `us-west-2a`, `us-west-2b`).
4. **Deploy**: Review settings, launch the stack, and wait a few minutes as CloudFormation builds the VPC.
5. **Retrieve Outputs**: After completion, check the "Outputs" tab for the VPC ID and subnet IDs—key details for your EKS cluster setup.

This approach ensures consistency and eliminates manual missteps.

## Permissions for Clusters, Node Groups, and Pods

To integrate this VPC with EKS, attach the right IAM permissions:
- **EKS Cluster**: The control plane needs an IAM role with:
  - `AmazonEKSClusterPolicy`: Manages VPC resources and subnets for the cluster.
- **Node Groups**: Worker nodes require an IAM role with:
  - `AmazonEKSWorkerNodePolicy`: Enables nodes to join the cluster.
  - `AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryReadOnly`: Allows pulling images from Amazon ECR.
  - `AmazonEKS_CNI_Policy`: Configures networking (e.g., VPC CNI plugin) for pod communication.
- **Pods**: For pods needing AWS service access (e.g., S3), use IAM Roles for Service Accounts (IRSA):
  - Create an IAM policy with specific permissions (e.g., `s3:GetObject`).
  - Associate it with a Kubernetes service account tied to the pod.

## Conclusion

Using CloudFormation to automate your EKS VPC setup streamlines the process, delivering a secure and scalable network with minimal effort. Pairing this with the right IAM permissions ensures your cluster, node groups, and pods operate flawlessly. Whether you're spinning up a test environment or a production cluster, this approach sets you up for success with EKS—fast, repeatable, and error-free.
